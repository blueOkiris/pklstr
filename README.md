# Pykkle String

## Description

A comprehensive dynamic string and wide string library in C.

Currently only supports Linux. Likely cross-platform, but no development is being spent to actively ensure that.

## Build

The build system is [ACBS](https://github.com/blueOkiris/acbs), which is small enough to include in the repo.

Run `chmod +x acbs && ./acbs build`

### Examples

Build the library first, then build any example with `./acbs build examples/<name>`
